They join Germany and Egypt, who along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature launched ENACT (Enhancing Nature-based Solutions for an Accelerated Climate Transformation) at COP27, which took place at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt in December 2022. Canada, the European Union, Spain, Malawi, Norway, South Korea, Japan and Slovenia were also founding members of the partnership.\r\nNature-based Solutions involve working with and for, rather than against nature, which is critical to deliver the climate, biodiversity, and land restoration action necessary to steward human well-being for all. \r\nAs evidenced by the growth of the ENACT Partnership, the role of Nature-based Solutions is increasingly being recognised as a complement to the rapid phase out of fossil fuels. ENACT provides cohesive and action-oriented leadership that enables us to tap into the massive potential of nature in addressing the climate emergency,&amp;quot; said Dr Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Director General.\r\nWe cannot achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement without drastically reducing the threat to biodiversity. Equally, we cannot meet the proposed targets and goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework without more ambitious emission reduction targets and more urgent adaptation actions, said Minister of Environment, Dr Yasmine Fouad, Arab Republic of Egypt. \r\nEgypt believes the success of ENACT in achieving its vision for increased coherence on NbS across the Rio Conventions will only be possible based on the committed participation of its current and potential partners. We urge all states and non-state actors committed to high-integrity NbS to come forward in support of the ENACT. Only with the momentum generated by a collective focus will we be able to achieve the goals set across the Rio Conventions and the SDG Agenda.\r\nThe Biden-Harris Administration sees Nature-based olutions as a critical tool to address the climate crisis, said White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory. I am excited to announce that the United States has joined the ENACT partnership. Not only do the goals of the partnership align with the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate and conservation priorities, they also give the United States a stronger footing to promote equity and justice in the face of climate change at home and abroad.&amp;quot;\r\nThe ENACT Partnership aims to enhance the protection from and resilience to climate impacts of at least 1 billion vulnerable people, secure up to 2.4 billion hectares of healthy natural and sustainable ecosystems, and significantly increase global mitigation efforts through protecting and restoring carbon-rich ecosystems.\r\nSince the initiative was launched last year, partners have been working on the first State of Nature-based Solutions report, which will provide the most comprehensive quantitative overview of global progress in implementing Nature-based Solutions commitments by both state and non-state actors. That report will be released early 2024, and will initiate the series of annual reports on ENACT’s NbS Goals.\r\nAt the same time, ENACT partners are pushing at COP28 for the following with respect to Nature-based Solutions:\r\nActions to limit warming to 1.5°C – by phasing out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas and embracing just transition – to minimise climate-related losses and damage to people and nature. Meeting this goal is also essential to the continued provision of crit', 1, '../../View/uploads/enact-launch.jpg', '2023-12-16', 1),
(8, 'Understanding power and politics for better conservation outcomes\n', 'Good intentions alone aren&#039;t enough. As WWF&#039;s Micol Martini writes, by understanding and engaging in power dynamics, conservationists can be more effective—and avoid unintended and sometimes harmful consequences of their work. \r\nDespite a longstanding moratorium on logging in the Congo Basin, illegal forest concessions granted by governments in the region are rife. In the Amazon, companies involved in illegal gold mining and logging often use political connections to protect their interests, or hide millions of dollars in profits in US real estate. In Brazil, bribery in the judiciary has facilitated land grabbing by agri-business. In Bangladesh, more than a third of climate adaptation funds are embezzled. And globally, supply chain collusion means around 30% of all timber is illegally harvested.\r\n\r\nIllegal and unsustainable natural resource exploitation enabled by crime and corruption, and related social and environmental impacts, occur because powerful groups and individuals benefit. Environmental corruption is ubiquitous and intentional—it is also frequently the elephant in the room that conservationists need to understand and address.\r\nHow PEA can help\r\nTackling harmful vested interests (those ways in which groups and people benefit from damage to the natural environment) and corruption (the abuse of power for private gain) requires us to understand who has power and how they are using it.\r\nThat’s why WWF and others are increasingly turning to and championing the use of political economy analysis—or PEA—across the conservation community. PEA is all about power: who has it, how and why they use it, and with that, how change happens. And there are two big reasons why we use it. \r\nFirstly, by understanding and engaging in power dynamics, we can be more effective. We see the profound impacts of vested interests on people and nature. Unless we tackle these, we will struggle to prevent injustice and environmental harm. Understanding power dynamics can help us uncover the root causes of the problems we are trying to address and find ways to work with political realities to effect change. \r\nSecondly, good intentions are not enough. For anyone with a humanitarian background, this adage will not be new. Nearly 40 years ago, Live Aid galvanised over £50 million in famine relief for Ethiopia, only for funding to become enmeshed in controversy over claims that its efforts inadvertently prolonged war and suffering in Ethiopia. Humanitarianism’s long struggle to balance a neutral, impartial mandate whilst working in highly politicised environments has given rise to the principle of Do No Harm, committing aid groups to preventing and mitigating negative impacts of their actions on people where they work. \r\nA similar challenge faces the conservation community. As conservationists, we operate in political contexts, both in the countries where we work and in our own daily lives, and we bring resources, influence, and power to the places where we engage. In complex, political environments, efforts to prevent and address climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental injustice can sometimes risk unintended consequences.\r\nFor instance, conservation efforts undertaken without understanding the political economy context may exacerbate inequalities. In addressing biodiversity loss and climate change, we must be alert to these risks and plan interventions that avoid and mitigate them. This can help ensure that conservation contributes to better governance and more equitable outcomes, benefiting those who live in and around biodiversity-rich areas.\r\nPEA allows us to pay explicit attention to these kinds of risks, unpack how our work might have unforeseen impacts, take more informed decisions about where and how we work, and make conscious choices about the balance of risks. See the scenario below for an illustration of how PEA can work.', 1, '../../View/uploads/6-steps-financial-planning-process-graph-4.png', '2023-12-16', 1),
(9, 'We must unite our efforts to fight climate change and biodiversity loss\n', 'Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most important challenges and risks for human societies. But as the chairs of IUCN&#039;s seven expert Commissions write, the window of opportunity to address them is closing rapidly.\r\nThe upcoming 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai comes at a critical time. Against a rapidly closing window of opportunity, we must overcome two of the most significant challenges for human societies: climate change and biodiversity loss. They are inseparable, interdependent, and mutually reinforcing. Our current approaches fall short of what scientific evidence indicates is needed to address them.\r\nThis task is core to the mission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN): to influence, encourage and assist societies worldwide to conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\r\nAs the seven elected Commission Chairs of the IUCN, we represent over 15,000 scientists, scholars, policy makers, economists, lawyers, and other experts who work on issues related to this mission. For the first time, we are writing collectively because COP28 represents not just an opportunity to assess our progress, but to issue a profound call to action. We must adopt a holistic approach that recognises the interdependence of the climate and biodiversity crises. (Read IUCN&#039;s position paper for COP28 here.)\r\nSolving these linked challenges demands bold and transformative efforts firmly anchored in science and the principles of justice and equity. At the core of the necessary whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach is the recognition that the fate of our planet rests not only in the hands of governments and institutions but also in the actions of the private sector, individuals, and communities. Responsibility falls on us all.\r\nFour key elements should guide debates at COP28 and beyond over how best to design and deploy innovative solutions to biodiversity loss and climate change.\r\nIntegration\r\nThese challenges require coherent, consistent, and integrated efforts on the part of governments at all levels, sectors, and systems; multilateral and bilateral institutions; communities; businesses; scientists and others to limit global warming to maximum 1.5oC, conserve and sustainably use biodiversity, and restore degraded ecosystems. Only by considering climate and biodiversity as parts of the same complex, systemic challenge— which also includes the actions, motivations, and aspirations of people—can we develop effective solutions that maximise benefits while minimizing risks.\r\nEcosystem Integrity\r\nWe must maintain, enhance, and restore ecosystem integrity. Sustaining healthy ecosystems is essential to halting biodiversity decline and species extinctions and to maintaining ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. Ambitious land- and ocean-based actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore ecosystems have co-benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation objectives. Such efforts can help to contain temperature rise to 1.5oC, provided that such actions complement—and are not in lieu of—ambitious reductions of emissions from fossil fuels, industrial processes, and land-use change.\r\nTransformation\r\nAddressing the biodiversity and climate crises will require systemic changes in the way we live, changes that can only be achieved through rapid and far-reaching actions across all sectors of a type, scale, and speed never before attempted. All actors, private and public, must begin the process of planning for transformative actions to protect biodiversity, rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts of climate change, and achieve sustainable development. Those actions must put society on the pathway to a positive vision of good quality of life in harmony with nature. Governments have a p', 1, '../../View/uploads/climate-change.jpg', '2023-12-16', 1),
(11, 'After COP28, questions remain for communities struggling with climate change', 'In the week since the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) came to an end, a cyclone slammed into Australia, torrential rains pelted the United States of America and a punishing drought continued to decimate crops in Zimbabwe.  \r\n\r\nThese disasters are a reminder, say experts, that while progress was made at COP28, not nearly enough financing has been devoted to helping communities adapt to extreme weather, which is expected to become more common as the Earth’s climate changes. \r\n\r\n“Frameworks and tentative commitments are not sufficient,” said Mirey Atallah, Head of the Nature for Climate Branch at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “We are no longer operating in an ‘if-and-when scenario’. Countless communities around the world are already suffering the fallout from climate change. Finance and action are needed everywhere, from mitigation, to loss and damage, to adaptation.” \r\n\r\nOn the climate adaptation front, COP28 started with groundbreaking news. The world agreed to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which will provide financial assistance to the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Unveiled in 2022, the fund attracted nearly $300 million in pledges at COP28. \r\n\r\n“The new Loss and Damage Fund, though a significant step forward, does not diminish the urgent need for adaptation finance,” said Alvin Chandra, Head of UNEP’s Global Adaptation Network. “As we saw in the latest Adaptation Gap Report, every dollar invested in adapting to coastal flooding could save $14 from loss and damage to the economy.” \r\n\r\nPublished by UNEP in the run up to COP28, this report set the scene for the conference’s discussions, highlighting a widening adaptation finance gap in developing countries – estimated at $US194 to US$366 billion per year. The publication was cited in the COP28 final text on the Global Stocktake, a key process to assess the progress of climate action. \r\n\r\nBeyond the Loss and Damage Fund, COP28 was not short on commitments. The United Arab Emirates President announced a US$30 billion fund for climate solutions, aiming to draw a total of US$250 billion of investments by 2030 for adaptation and mitigation. \r\n\r\nThe United States pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, taking its second replenishment to almost US$13 billion, of which half is devoted to adaptation. A total of US$1 billion was announced for climate and health initiatives, along with almost US$200 million for the Global Environment Facility and around US$170 million for the Adaptation Fund. \r\n\r\nExperts were quick to point out, though, that funding announcements alone are not enough. \r\n\r\n“It’s not just the amount of adaptation finance that counts. It’s also about the effectiveness and quality of the finance,” said Atallah “We really need to dig deeper into how fast it is reaching the countries and communities that need it the most.” \r\n\r\nThe COP28 final decision reiterated a call from 2021 for developed countries “to at least double” adaptation finance for developing nations, and an agreement was reached to prepare a report to assess progress on that effort.', 13, '../../View/uploads/log1.jpg', '2024-01-02', 1),

ENACT is a voluntary coalition of state and non-state actors, co-chaired by Egypt and Germany. IUCN will host the ENACT Secretariat, which will lead the implementation of the initiative. \"Nature-based solutions are making significant contributions to efforts to address climate change, but their huge potential is still largely untapped. Egypt is championing the ENACT initiative as it will boost integrated, well-coordinated Nature-based Solutions on a global scale, in line with the scale and urgency of the climate crisis,\" said Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment of the Arab Republic of Egypt and COP27 Climate Envoy. \"Nature is our most powerful ally in combating the climate and biodiversity crises. Intact ecosystems store carbon dioxide, secure our food and water supplies and protect against disasters. Nature-based Solutions can create jobs and contribute to economic and social development. But to achieve this, they need to be supported by effective safeguards and standards. This is something we pay close attention to in both our international and national projects,\" said Steffi Lemke, German Federal Environment Minister. As a key outcome of ENACT, the secretariat will compile an annual State of Nature-based Solutions report, to be delivered to the COP Presidencies ahead of future UN Climate Change gatherings. The report will provide the most comprehensive quantitative overview of global progress in implementing NbS commitments by both state and non-state actors. \"This COP has reinforced that the time for climate action is now, and Nature-based Solutions have a key role to play. They must deliver high-integrity outcomes, consistent with robust environmental and social safeguards. It is time to bring together Parties and Nature-based Solutions experts around the world to accelerate meaningful integrated climate-biodiversity action. I look forward to learning more about ENACT’s progress through the State of Nature-based Solutions Report that will be shared at COP28 in the UAE,\" said Razan Al Mubarak, IUCN President. \"While there is growing recognition of the potential of Nature-based Solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation, global efforts across sectors have been largely disconnected. The ENACT partnership will strengthen coordination, ensure high-integrity NbS actions that follow ecological and social safeguards, and, crucially, quantify and track progress,” said Dr Bruno Oberle, IUCN Director General.

The Tanzania team helped elaborate the National Forest and Landscape Restoration Strategy, which will work with a number of policies to outline strategic objectives for landscape restoration, define priority measures and actions, and establish financing and monitoring arrangements. Similarly, in Cameroon, the team provided restoration recommendations developed from its ROAM assessments integrated into the national Harmonized Action Plan for the Restoration of Degraded Land and Forest Landscapes in Cameroon. In Guinea Bissau, the TRI team contributed to the National Mangrove Law and National Mangrove Strategy, providing input into policies filling gaps and regulating the sustainable management of the country’s mangrove ecosystems. The Forest and Landscape Restoration Implementation Action Pan in Kenya was also facilitated by both the TRI Kenya ASAL and TRI Tana Delta teams, which provided technical recommendations and helped consult stakeholders to ensure its passing.\nCounty and Subnational Plans Integrating FLR\n\nVarious country teams also worked to integrate restoration and sustainable land management into county and subnational plans to ensure local implementation of FLR practices. The Kenya ASAL team provided technical input and logistical support for the creation of three County Environment Action Plans, integrating natural resource management and FLR at the county and local level (Marsabit, Isiolo, and Laikipia counties), while the Kenya Tana Delta team worked to mainstream FLR into county budgetary processes and elaborate the Lamu and Tana River County Integrated Development plans to include FLR and sustainable land management. In aims to address forest degradation, the TRI Pakistan team facilitated the development of forest management and landscape restoration frameworks in the four districts of Sherani, Chitral, South West, and Gilgit Baltisan (Diamer). On the subnational level, the TRI team in the Democratic Republic of Congo helped develop the Provincial Strategy for the Restoration of Forests and Landscapes in South Kivu, which outlines the priorities and actions to be taken for FLR, including best practices on the protection of subsistence crops, promotion of fodder production for livestock, and classification of potential restoration options depending on geographic zone.\n\nFilling Knowledge Gaps and Conducting Policy Research\n\nIn three countries, the TRI teams also aimed to fill knowledge gaps and provide research to identify FLR-related areas and interventions that needed to be prioritized in policy development. In China, the TRI team developed policy suggestions on promoting the green development of State Forest Farms and a research report on innovative management mechanisms and systems of state-owned forest farms.

Attendees are expected to explore how countries can enhance their cooperation with MEAs, which are helping the world do everything from counter forever chemicals to protect bats. \n\nUNEA-6 will be held at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, from 26 February to 1 March 2024. As the gathering nears, we spoke with Patricia Kameri-Mbote, Director of the UNEP Law Division, about why MEAs are so important in addressing environmental challenges and how UNEA-6 will provide a platform for enhancing engagement around them.  \n\nWhat are MEAs and how do they work?  \n\nPatricia Kameri-Mbote (PKM): MEAs are international agreements that address the most pressing environmental issues of global or regional concern and are critical instruments of international environmental governance and international environmental law. They cover a wide scope of issues, ranging from the protection of the atmosphere to the sustainable management of chemicals and waste, to halting nature and biodiversity loss.  \n\nWhat bodies participate in MEAs? \n\nPKM: States, regional economic integration organizations, and, in some instances, international organizations become party to MEAs with national governments responsible for implementing them. \n\nWhat are some of the barriers to the implementation of MEAs?  \n\nPKM: Addressing the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and waste and pollution, as well as other global environmental challenges, requires efficient international cooperation. Despite efforts by the international community, environmental degradation is continuing. Hence, we need to unite forces at all levels to address the impacts and drivers of environmental degradation more effectively. In this regard, strengthening implementation of and compliance with the MEAs is a key area of action. These agreements have emerged as one of the best ways of institutionalizing intergovernmental cooperation and triggering national action in the environmental sector.\nUNEA-6 will focus on multilateral action to overcome environmental challenges. Which MEAs have been particularly successful in that regard? \n\nPKM: There are many success stories of effective multilateral action through MEAs over the years. I will share two examples to illustrate this. The first one is the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. With universal ratification, the protocol has been extremely successful in its original aim of cutting the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances. Nearly 99 per cent of ozone-depleting substances have been phased-out to date, resulting in the recovery of the ozone layer protecting us from harmful sun rays that cause skin cancer.   \n\nSimilarly, the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES), has made significant progress preventing more species from becoming threatened by trade and enabled the recovery of species that were endangered.

It exposes a concerning disparity between the volumes of finance to nature-based solutions and nature-negative finance flows, and underscores the urgency to address the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation.\n\n“Nature-based solutions are dramatically underfunded. Annual nature-negative investments are over 30 times larger than financing for nature-based solutions that promote a stable climate, and healthy land and nature. To have any chance of meeting the sustainable development goals, these numbers must be flipped – with true custodians of the land, such as Indigenous Peoples, among the chief beneficiaries,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.\n\nThe findings are based on an analysis of global financial flows, revealing that private nature-negative finance flows amount to US$5 trillion annually, 140 times larger than the US$35 billion of private investments in nature-based solutions. The five industries channeling most of the negative financial flows – construction, electric utilities, real estate, oil and gas, and food and tobacco – represent 16per cent of overall investment flows in the economybut 43per cent of nature-negative flows associated with the destruction of forests, wetlands, and other natural habitats.\n\nNiki Mardas, Executive Director of Global Canopy said, “This year’s report is a stark reminder that continuing with “business as usual” poses a severe threat to our planet, reinforcing the urgent need for a transition to sustainable business practices and to stop the financing of nature destruction. The net is tightening, with increased regulatory pressure in key areas like tackling deforestation, it means that those companies and financial institutions still driving the problem now need to make best use of the excellent data, guidance and frameworks already available to urgently commit to a nature-positive future.\"\n\nGovernment spending on environmentally harmful subsidies in four sectors - agriculture, fossil fuels, fishery, and forestry - is estimated at US$1.7 trillion in 2022. As leaders gather in Dubai this week, reforming and repurposing environmentally harmful subsidies, particularly to fossil fuels and agriculture, will be critical. Fossil fuel subsidies to consumers alone doubled from US$563 billion in 2021 to US$1.163 billion in 2022.\n\nFinance gap persists\n\nThe report identifies a significant financing gap for nature-based solutions, with only US$200 billion allocated in 2022, led by governments, who contributed 82 per cent (US$165 billion), while private finance remains modest at US$35 billion (18 per cent of total nature-based solutions finance flows). To meet the Rio Convention targets on limiting climate change to 1.5C, as well as the Global Biodiversity Framework target to set aside 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030 and achieve land degradation neutrality, finance flows to nature-based solutions must almost triple from current levels (US$200 billion) to reach US$542 billion per year by 2030 and quadruple to US$737 billion by 2050.\n\nBoth public funding and private investment need to increase dramatically, in conjunction with the re-alignment of finance flows that have a detrimental impact on nature. While public funding will continue to play a critical role, private finance can potentially increase its share of nature-based finance from 18 per cent currently to 33 per cen', 13, '../../View/uploads/log8.jpg', '2023-12-09', 2),

The Earth sweltered under record heat, nature continued its precipitous decline and pollution continued to claim millions of lives.\n\nBut amid all that, there is reason for hope, say those on the frontlines of the effort to create a more sustainable world.\nThe ozone layer, which protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation, is on track to recover within the next four decades, revealed a report from several scientific organizations, including UNEP. The Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion – 2022 found the planet’s sun shield could reach 1980 values over Antarctica by 2066 and over the Arctic by 2045.\n\nExperts attributed the rebound to the Montreal Protocol, a planet-wide agreement adopted in 1987 to phase out many ozone-depleting chemicals. A 2016 amendment is also helping to rein in a series of powerful greenhouse gases and could avoid up to 0.5°C of global warming by 2100, the report found.\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that many advocates hailed as an important step in the campaign for climate justice.\n\nSpearheaded by the cyclone-wracked nation of Vanuatu, the resolution asks the International Court of Justice for an opinion on whether countries have a legal duty to address climate change and what the legal consequences of climate inaction could be. Experts say the court’s opinion, which is pending, would not be legally binding but would carry moral authority and some legal weight.\n\nThe resolution came as a growing number of people around the world turned to courts to compel governments and businesses to act on climate change. A UNEP study, released later in the year, found climate-related lawsuits have more than doubled since 2017.', 13, '../../View/uploads/log9.jpg', '2023-12-28', 1),
(50, 'Inside the 20-year campaign to rid the world of leaded fuel\n', 'On 9 December 1921 at a General Motors laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, chemists poured a teaspoonful of a compound called tetraethyl lead into a spasming motor.\n\nThey were hoping to stop what’s known as ‘knock’ - the wild and potentially engine-destroying vibrations that come from burning low-grade petrol.\n\nAlmost immediately after adding the tetraethyl lead, the motor began to “purr”, recounts Sharon Bertsch McGrayne in her book Prometheans in the Lab.\n\nAnd so leaded petrol was born.\n\nIn the months to come, the fuel would be hailed as a breakthrough, one that would power a new generation of cars, planes and motorcycles.\n\nThere was just one problem: leaded exhaust is toxic. As leaded fuel spread to every corner of the world, it was followed by epidemics of heart disease, cancer, stroke and, most vividly, developmental delays in children.\n\n“Leaded petrol was a huge mistake from the start, even if people may not have known it at the time,” said Rob De Jong, the head of sustainable mobility at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “The world would be dealing with the consequences for a century.”\n\nToday that toxic legacy officially came to an end. At a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the last country to use leaded petrol, Algeria, had phased out the fuel. For the first time since 1923, no driver on the planet will be legally able to fill their tank with lead-infused petrol.\n\n“The successful enforcement of the ban on leaded petrol is a huge milestone for global health and our environment,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.\n\nThe announcement followed a two-decade-long campaign, led by UNEP, to help the world abandon leaded fuel. The drive, part of the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles, used a mix of science, public education, policy work and shame to score a stunning environmental victory. Estimates have found that every year, leaded fuel bans save more than 1.2 million lives while helping the global economy avoid $2.4 trillion in healthcare expenses and other costs.\n\n\"I think this may be the single biggest success story in the environmental field,” said Michael Walsh, the former head of motor vehicle pollution control programmes with the United States\' Environmental Protection Agency.', 13, '../../View/uploads/log10.jpeg', '2023-12-27', 0);
